// Example of using API keys, uses openWeatherAPI, so we'll need most of this information
// https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/how-to-use-api-keys

// Header in HTML
// Search area in HTML
// Landscape card containing current weather parameters for location
// 5 vertical cards(maybe?) for next five days' forecast
// Link to those font-fantastic mini images to use for search button, etc.

// Current weather - display time weather was last updated

//  High and low for day
//  Current temp
// feels like
// wind direction and speed
// Sky condition (cloudy, etc.)


// 5 day-cards style: hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
// use five different colors for cards (then use that blue and white from skis as the rest of the page?)
// Use cards with rounded corners, the cliche?
// Use circles for card shapes?
// Could get really against-grain - maybe use different sized cards for each day?
// CAN WE GET A LIVE-UPDATE RADAR??
// Can we add an individual HTML page that is link to in the 5-day cards? Maybe it autofills one generic HTML with the day's full-detail forecast


// Make sure to add media-queries to allow use over multiple devices, as well as accessibility features for screen readers
